Github syntax highlighting theme for gvim

This is a port of github's lovely light-background syntax highlighting theme.  I tried to make it as comprehensive as possible; it should look good with: 
- Completion menus 
- Diffsplit 
- STL highlighting 

It's not an exact replica (don't expect it to highlight exactly the same
code elements in the same colours), but it's pretty close - enjoy!
